            <p>Welcome! I'm <strong>Krystal Stewart</strong>, My journey in tech began with a simple curiosity about how things work in the IT industry as I have innovative ideas and my ultimate goal is to own a cyber security consulting firm and expand my networks.</p>

            <h2>Why Technology?</h2>
            <p>Technology chose me as much as I chose it. Growing up in Jamaica, I witnessed firsthand how limited access to technology and digital resources could hold back talented individuals. This disparity ignited a fire within me to be part of the solution.</p>

            <p>I believe that technology is the great equalizer‚Äîit has the power to democratize education, create economic opportunities, and connect people across barriers. The Caribbean has immense untapped potential, and I'm committed to being part of the movement that transforms this region.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, I am an advocate for bringing forth justice and I am committed to putting a stop to perpetrators who gain unauthorized access to systems and carry out malicious attacks. Technology isn't just my career path; it's my platform for change.</p>
